                question: "What is Kepler's First Law?",
                answer: "Planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. This means planets don't move in perfect circles - their distance from the Sun varies throughout their orbit."
            },
            {
                question: "Explain Kepler's Second Law in simple terms.",
                answer: "Equal areas in equal times. As a planet orbits, it sweeps out equal areas of space in equal time periods. This means planets move faster when closer to the Sun and slower when farther away."
            },
            {
                question: "What does Kepler's Third Law tell us?",
                answer: "The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the Sun. Mathematical relationship: P² ∝ a³. Farther planets take much longer to orbit."
            },

            // Gravity and Universal Laws
            {
                question: "State Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.",
                answer: "Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. F = G(m₁m₂)/r²"
            },
            {
                question: "What is an inverse square law? Give an example.",
                answer: "A relationship where doubling the distance makes the effect 4 times weaker (2² = 4). Examples: gravity, light intensity, electric force. If distance triples, effect becomes 9 times weaker."
            },
            {
                question: "Explain Newton's First Law of Motion.",
                answer: "Objects at rest stay at rest, objects in motion stay in motion, unless acted upon by a net external force. This is also called the law of inertia."
            },
            {
                question: "What is Newton's Second Law of Motion?",
                answer: "The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. F = ma"
            },
            {
                question: "State Newton's Third Law of Motion.",
                answer: "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Forces always come in pairs - when you push on something, it pushes back on you with equal force."
            },

            // Conservation Laws
            {
                question: "What is conservation of angular momentum?",
                answer: "The total angular momentum of a system stays constant unless external torques act on it. Example: ice skater spins faster when pulling arms in, star spins faster when collapsing."
            },
            {
                question: "Why do stars spin faster as they collapse?",
                answer: "Conservation of angular momentum. As the star's radius decreases, its rotation rate must increase to keep angular momentum (L = mvr) constant."
            },

            // Earth's Motion and Seasons
            {
                question: "What causes Earth's seasons?",
                answer: "Earth's axial tilt of 23.5°. Different hemispheres receive more direct sunlight at different times of year. It's NOT caused by Earth's changing distance from the Sun!"
            },
            {
                question: "Define the summer solstice.",
                answer: "The day when the Sun is highest in the sky for the Northern Hemisphere (around June 21). The North Pole tilts maximally toward the Sun, giving the longest day of the year."
            },
            {
                question: "What is an equinox?",
                answer: "When day and night are approximately equal length everywhere on Earth (around March 21 and September 21). The Sun is directly over the equator."
            },
            {
                question: "Explain the difference between a solar day and a sidereal day.",
                answer: "Solar day: time for Sun to return to same position (24 hours). Sidereal day: time for Earth to rotate once relative to stars (23h 56m). Solar day is longer because Earth orbits the Sun."
            },

            // Coordinate Systems
            {
                question: "What is latitude?",
                answer: "Angular distance north or south of the equator, measured in degrees. Range: 0° (equator) to 90°N (North Pole) or 90°S (South Pole)."
            },
            {
                question: "What is longitude?",
                answer: "Angular distance east or west of the Prime Meridian (Greenwich), measured in degrees. Range: 0° to 180°E or 180°W."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the zenith?",
                answer: "The point in the sky directly overhead from any given location. It's 90° above the horizon."
            },

            // Moon and Lunar Phenomena
            {
                question: "What causes Moon phases?",
                answer: "Our changing view of the Moon's sunlit side as it orbits Earth. The Moon is always half-lit by the Sun, but we see different portions of that lit side."
            },
            {
                question: "What is tidal locking?",
                answer: "When an object's rotation period equals its orbital period. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth - we always see the same side because it rotates once per orbit."
            },
            {
                question: "Explain the difference between lunar and solar eclipses.",
                answer: "Lunar eclipse: Earth blocks sunlight from reaching the Moon (Earth between Sun and Moon). Solar eclipse: Moon blocks sunlight from reaching Earth (Moon between Sun and Earth)."
            },
            {
                question: "What causes tides on Earth?",
                answer: "Gravitational pull of the Moon (and Sun). Water on the side closest to the Moon is pulled more strongly than Earth's center, creating a bulge. A second bulge forms on the opposite side."
            },

            // Electromagnetic Radiation
            {
                question: "List the electromagnetic spectrum from longest to shortest wavelength.",
                answer: "Radio waves → Microwaves → Infrared → Visible light → Ultraviolet → X-rays → Gamma rays. Remember: longer wavelength = lower frequency = lower energy."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the speed of light? Does it vary for different types of EM radiation?",
                answer: "3×10⁸ m/s in vacuum. All electromagnetic radiation travels at the same speed in vacuum, regardless of wavelength or frequency."
            },
            {
                question: "What is blackbody radiation?",
                answer: "Light emitted by any object with temperature above absolute zero. Hotter objects emit more light at shorter wavelengths (appear bluer), cooler objects at longer wavelengths (redder)."
            },
            {
                question: "Distinguish between continuous, emission, and absorption spectra.",
                answer: "Continuous: all colors present (hot dense object). Emission: bright lines at specific wavelengths (hot thin gas). Absorption: dark lines in continuous spectrum (cool gas in front of hot source)."
            },

            // Atomic Structure
            {
                question: "Describe the basic structure of an atom.",
                answer: "Dense nucleus (protons and neutrons) at center, surrounded by electrons in specific energy levels. Nucleus is tiny but contains almost all the mass."
            },
            {
                question: "What determines an element's chemical properties?",
                answer: "The number of protons (atomic number). This determines how many electrons the atom has and how they're arranged, which controls chemical behavior."
            },
            {
                question: "What are isotopes?",
                answer: "Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. Same chemical properties but different mass. Example: Carbon-12 and Carbon-14."
            },
            {
                question: "How do atoms emit light?",
                answer: "When electrons drop from higher to lower energy levels, they emit photons. The photon's energy (and color) equals the difference between energy levels."
            },
            {
                question: "How do atoms absorb light?",
                answer: "When photons with exactly the right energy hit atoms, electrons can jump to higher energy levels, absorbing that specific wavelength of light."
            },

            // Telescopes and Observations
            {
                question: "What are the two main types of optical telescopes?",
                answer: "Refracting telescopes (use lenses to focus light) and reflecting telescopes (use mirrors). Large modern telescopes are reflectors because mirrors can be built larger and lighter."
